	Building on what I learned from the Snake game, I decided to create another classic arcade game: Space Invaders.

	In Space Invaders, your goal is to shoot down waves of advancing aliens. But be careful the aliens fight back and will shoot at you too. As you destroy more of them, they get faster, making them harder to avoid. The game ends when you either defeat all the aliens or lose all your lives. Use the arrow keys to move your ship left and right, and press the space bar to fire a bullet forward.
